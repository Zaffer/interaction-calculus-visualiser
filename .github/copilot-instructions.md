### Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Keep things simple, always always keep it simple! DO NOT overcomplicate things.
- **Minimal Code**: Less code is better, least possible code to get it just barely working, be concise.
- **Best Practices**: Always use current best practices.
- **Modern Standards**: Assume latest versions of dependencies and language features.
- **Declarative Approach**: Favor declarative code over imperative when possible

### Guidelines

- Use modern TypeScript features (latest syntax, strict typing)
- Leverage RxJS for reactive, declarative data flow
- Keep functions small and focused on single responsibilities
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions - solve the problem at hand
- Prefer composition over inheritance

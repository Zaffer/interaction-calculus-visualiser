## TODO

- [ ] init


## Background
- Visualisation of the [Interaction Calculus](https://github.com/VictorTaelin/Interaction-Calculus)

   npm install
   npm start
   ```
 `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

The application initializes a 3D scene of visualizations using THREE.js and WebGPU.

### Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Keep things simple - complexity is the enemy
- **Minimal Code**: Less code is better - prefer concise, readable solutions
- **Best Practices**: Always use current best practices and latest language features
- **Modern Standards**: Assume latest versions of dependencies and language features
- **Declarative Approach**: Favor declarative code over imperative when possible

### Guidelines

- Use modern TypeScript features (latest syntax, strict typing)
- Leverage RxJS for reactive, declarative data flow
- Prefer functional programming patterns where appropriate
- Keep functions small and focused on single responsibilities
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions - solve the problem at hand
- Prefer composition over inheritance
